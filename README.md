# conformal-change-localization

This repository contains an implementation of the CONCH algorithm for conformal changepoint localization and several related experiments. To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory. Then, the cells in our Jupyter notebook (`simulations.ipynb`) can be run sequentially.

The supplemental material (containing appendices for the main paper) is also included in the supplemental material in the root directory.

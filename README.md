# conformal-change-localization

This repository contains an implementation of the [CONCH algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00292) for conformal changepoint localization and several related experiments, including using an MNIST digit classifier to localize a digit change and using an LLM to localize a sentiment change. To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory. Then, the cells in our Jupyter notebook (`simulations.ipynb`) can be run sequentially.
